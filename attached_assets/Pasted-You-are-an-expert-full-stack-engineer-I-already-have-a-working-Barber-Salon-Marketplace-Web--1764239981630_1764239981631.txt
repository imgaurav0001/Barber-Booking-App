You are an expert full-stack engineer.

I already have a working **Barber & Salon Marketplace Web App** with:
- Customer / Barber / Admin roles
- Home page, shop details, booking system, and dashboards
- Login / Register with role selection
- “Modern Gentleman” design (Deep Navy, Gold, Off-White)

⚠️ IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT rebuild the app from scratch.
- Keep the current design, theme, and structure.
- Just FIX and REFINE the behavior as described below.

================================================
1️⃣ CUSTOMER PROFILE – MUST SHOW CORRECT BOOKINGS
================================================

Problem:
- When a **customer is logged in**, the profile/dashboard section is not working properly and does NOT show their bookings correctly.

What I want:
- When a customer logs in and opens their **Profile / Dashboard**:
  - It should show:
    - Their basic details: name, email, role = "Customer"
    - A clear **“My Bookings”** section that lists ONLY this customer’s bookings.

“My Bookings” must display, for each booking:
- Shop name
- Service name(s)
- Date & Time
- Status (Pending, Approved, Rejected, Completed)

Also:
- Separate upcoming and past bookings OR clearly label them.
- If the customer has no bookings, show a friendly message like:
  “You don’t have any bookings yet.”

Key rule:
- A customer must **only see their own bookings**, never other users’ bookings.

Please:
- Fix the backend API and frontend wiring so that:
  - The bookings are fetched using the currently logged-in customer’s ID.
  - The customer dashboard reliably displays their bookings every time.

======================================================
2️⃣ WHO CAN ADD / LIST A SHOP – ONLY BARBER / SHOP OWNER
======================================================

Problem:
- Right now, when a customer is logged in, the functionality for listing a shop is wrong/unclear.

What I want:
- Normal **customers should NOT be able to list/add a shop**.
- Only **barber / shop owner** accounts should have the option to add and manage a shop.

Desired behavior:

A. CUSTOMER role:
- Can:
  - Browse shops
  - View shop details
  - Book services
  - See their bookings in profile
- Cannot:
  - Add a shop
  - Manage services
  - Access admin portal

B. BARBER / SHOP OWNER role:
- When logged in as barber, there should be a clear option in their dashboard:
  - “Add Your Shop” or “Create Shop”

- The **Add Shop** form should include at least:
  - Shop name
  - Shop address
  - Description
  - Barber / owner name (or this can come from the logged-in user)
  - Services list:
    - Service name
    - Short description
    - Price
    - Duration (in minutes)

- After submission:
  - The shop should be created and linked to that barber user.
  - The shop should go into a **Pending Approval** state until admin approves it.

- Barber dashboard should allow:
  - Viewing and editing their shop details.
  - Viewing bookings made by customers for their shop.
  - Approving or rejecting those bookings.

Please:
- Make sure that:
  - Only users with barber role see “Add Shop / Manage Shop” options.
  - Customers never see those options.

=========================================
3️⃣ SINGLE ADMIN USER ONLY – LOCK ADMIN
=========================================

Requirement:
- There must be exactly **one real admin account**:
  - Email: `admin123@gmail.com`
  - Password: `admin123`
  - Role: `admin`

Admin rules:

1. Only this user can access the **Admin Portal**.
2. If any other user tries to visit the admin route/page:
   - They should be blocked (access denied) or redirected.
3. Even if someone tries to register with role=admin from UI:
   - They should NOT become a real admin.
   - Only the hardcoded/seeding admin user above is treated as admin.

Admin abilities:
- Can log in and open **Admin Dashboard**.
- Can see list of shops waiting for approval.
- Can **Approve** or **Reject** shops.
- (If reviews moderation already exists) can approve/reject reviews.

Please:
- Enforce admin checks by both:
  - role = admin
  - email = `admin123@gmail.com`
- Protect admin routes (backend and frontend) so that no other account can reach the admin portal or perform admin actions.

=========================================
4️⃣ BARBER DASHBOARD – MANAGE BUSINESS
=========================================

Desired simple behavior:

- **Customer**:
  - Logs in → sees profile + only their own bookings.

- **Barber**:
  - Logs in → sees:
    - Option to create/edit their shop (name, address, services, prices, durations).
    - List of customer bookings for their shop.
    - Buttons to **Approve** or **Reject** those bookings.

- **Admin** (`admin123@gmail.com` / `admin123`):
  - Logs in → sees admin portal.
  - Can approve or reject shops (and reviews if present).

Please:
- Check all role-based pages and buttons.
- Make sure each role only sees and does what is described above.

=========================================
5️⃣ SUMMARY AFTER CHANGES
=========================================

After you finish, please:
- Briefly summarize:
  - What you fixed for the customer profile bookings.
  - How the “Add Shop” flow now works for barbers.
  - How the single admin account and admin portal are now restricted.
- Confirm example logins to test:
  - Admin: `admin123@gmail.com` / `admin123`
  - One demo customer (if available)
  - One demo barber (if available)

Keep the existing design (Modern Gentleman style) and only refine the logic and role behavior as requested.
