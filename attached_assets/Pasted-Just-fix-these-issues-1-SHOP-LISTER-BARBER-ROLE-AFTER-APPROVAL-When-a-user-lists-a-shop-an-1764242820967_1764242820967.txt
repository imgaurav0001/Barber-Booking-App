Just fix these issues:

1) SHOP LISTER / BARBER ROLE AFTER APPROVAL
- When a user lists a shop and the admin approves it, the same account should act as a **shop owner/barber** when they log in.
- After login:
  - If user has an approved shop → show **shop owner/barber dashboard** with their shop + bookings.
  - They should NOT be treated only as a normal customer.
- The approved shop should display its own barbers (added by that user), not empty.

2) FOOTER LINKS + WRITE REVIEW + YEAR
- “Write a Review” in the footer must open a proper review flow:
  - Only logged-in customers.
  - Step 1: choose one of their booked shops.
  - Step 2: rating (1–5) + text review.
  - Submit → attach review to that shop and show it on the shop detail page.
- “About Us” should open a section/page with a short, genuine description text.
- “Contact Us” should open a simple contact section/page (support email, dummy phone, short message form with success message).
- Footer currently just scrolls to top or does nothing → every footer item must do something meaningful.
- Change “© 2024 …” to “© 2025 …”.

3) HEADER “DISCOVER” LINK
- The “Discover” item in the header should scroll the user to the **shops list section** on the home page (smooth scroll).

4) HARDCODED NAME “Alex M.”
- Remove the hard-coded name “Alex M.” everywhere.
- In navbar/profile and any “Welcome” text, show the **actual logged-in user’s name** from auth data.
- If no name exists, fall back to the user’s email prefix.

5) BARBER CARDS: PHOTOS + “ANY AVAILABLE” OPTION
- Two barbers currently show the same profile photo in the “Choose Your Barber” section.
  - Change at least one to a different image so they look distinct.
- Add an extra selectable option: **“Any Available Barber”** in the barber selection step:
  - When chosen, the booking is not tied to a specific barber, just to the shop.
  - Keep existing logic for specific barber choice as well.

After changes, verify:
- Shop lister logs in and sees their shop owner view.
- Footer links work and show real content; year is 2025.
- Discover scrolls to the shops section.
- Logged-in user’s name appears instead of “Alex M.”.
- Barber cards have different photos and include an “Any Available Barber” option.
